## Installation

You can install Discordify directly from [PyPI]():

```bash
pip install discordify
```

## Features

Discordify offers five different text transformation functions:

### 1. Stutterify
Adds a stuttering effect to your text, making it look like you're nervous or excited!

```python
from discordify import discordify

# Add stuttering effect
text = "Hello, how are you? I am fine, but tired."
stuttered = discordify.stutterify(text)
print(stuttered)
# Output: "H-Hello, how are y-you? I-I am fine, but... tired."
```

### 2. UwUify
Transforms your text into the cute "UwU" speak popular in some Discord communities.

```python
from discordify import discordify

# Make text cute and add sparkles
text = "Hello. How are you?"
uwu_text = discordify.uwuify(text)
print(uwu_text)
# Output: "‚úßÀñ¬∞. hewwoÀöÔΩ°‚ãÜ‡≠®‡≠ßÀö‚ãÜÀô‚ü° how awe you? ‚ÇäÀö‚äπ‚ô°"
```

### 3. Leetify
Converts your text into "1337" (leet) speak by replacing letters with numbers.

```python
from discordify import discordify

# Convert to 1337 speak
text = "Hi, how are you?"
leet_text = discordify.leetify(text)
print(leet_text)
# Output: "H1, H0W 4R3 Y0U?"
```

### 4. Dummify
Reverses all vowels in your text for a silly transformation.

```python
from discordify import discordify

# Reverse vowels
text = "Hi, how are you?"
dummy_text = discordify.dummify(text)
print(dummy_text)
# Output: "Hu, how era yoi?"
```

### 5. Sarcasmify
Transforms text with alternating uppercase and lowercase letters to express sarcasm.

```python
from discordify import discordify

# Add sarcasm style
text = "Yeah, sure, whatever you say"
sarcasm_text = discordify.sarcasmify(text)
print(sarcasm_text)
# Output might be: "YeAh, SuRe, WhAtEvEr YoU sAy üôÑ"
```
### 5. Piratify
Transforms text into a pirate speak.
```python
from discordify import discordify

# Add pirate speak
text = "Hello how are you"
pirate_text = discordify.piratify(text)
print(pirate_text)
# Output might be: "ahoy how be ye yarr harr! üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è"
```
## Command Line Usage

Discordify can also be used directly from the command line:

```bash
# Install the package
pip install discordify

# Run the CLI
discordify
```

Then follow the prompts to select a function and enter your text.

## Example Program

Here's a complete example program that demonstrates all functions:

```python
# example.py
from discordify import discordify

def demonstrate_discordify():
    sample_text = "Hello, world! Let's try all these transformations."
    
    print("Original text:")
    print(sample_text)
    print("\n1. Stutterify:")
    print(discordify.stutterify(sample_text))
    print("\n2. UwUify:")
    print(discordify.uwuify(sample_text))
    print("\n3. Leetify:")
    print(discordify.leetify(sample_text))
    print("\n4. Dummify:")
    print(discordify.dummify(sample_text))
    print("\n5. Sarcasmify:")
    print(discordify.sarcasmify(sample_text))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    demonstrate_discordify()
```

Save this as `example.py` and run it with `python example.py`.
